# Data Analysis Using Python 

## Introduction 

Data Science and analysis is playing the most significant role today covering every industry in the market.For e.g finance,e-commerce,business,education,government. Now organizations play a 360-degree role to analyze the behavior and interest of their customers to make decisions in favor of them. Data is analyzed through a programming language such as python which is one of the most versatile languages and helps in doing a lot of things through it. Netflix is a pure data science project that reached the top by analyzing every single interest of their customers. Keywords: Data Visualization, AnacondaJupyter Notebook, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning.
